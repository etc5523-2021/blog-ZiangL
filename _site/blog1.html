<p>In the daily COVID-19 cases confirmed table, there is a surprising finding. The number of new cases in 03Jun 2020 and 24July 2021 is Negative. This situation may be caused by an error in the previous test result, or other reasons. The data is limited, so that no in-depth analysis will be done in this blog.</p>
